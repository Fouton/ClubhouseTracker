# Clubhouse Tracker

## Features:
- Autotracks Items Received
- Autosends Locations Checked
- Autotracks YAML Settings
- Autocalculates Num of Beatable Games (available)
- Autocalculates Num of Games Beaten (completed)
- Hidden Setting that shows two locations on the Globe which send Victory / Release commands when checked

## How to Mark Completed Games:
- Manually mark a location of a game as completed counts it as completed

## Quirks with Completed Games:
- If someone !collects items, you may have fully cleared games that you havent beaten. To mark the game as beaten you will need to uncheck and recheck one of the locations of that game
- If you reload the tracker and reconnect with an incorrect completed count, uncheck and recheck a location on each game you have completed (make sure it is a check that was already completed)
- If you make a mistake, reload the tracker and do the above step (unmark and remark each game)
